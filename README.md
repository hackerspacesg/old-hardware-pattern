# Old Hardware Pattern (OHP)
HackerspaceSG's implementation of the Old Hardware Pattern

Items marked for OHP will be sent out in the mailing list and then people can claim the said items. The spreadsheet of items are available here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hT51CnIa6W7G3U0w4u7avXP5-G7s00iWaU7RDWebWR4/edit#gid=0

Currently, Jun Hao has volunteered to be in charge of the OHP. However, all members are encouraged to assist Jun Hao so that the OHP process can be carried out smoothly. This is because all members have the obligation/responsibility of keeping the space neat and tidy.
